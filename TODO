- Move to a model where we never fetch external resources in the hot path.
  Instead, use the GAE cron mechanism to periodically trigger refreshing
  external resources.

- Potentially use uwsgi cache to get response generation times down towards
  microseconds (now we have ~5-10 ms spent in the WSGI app)

- Make /timeseries endpoint use the CSV file in the repository, for
  consistency

- Add more state resources to the README
